    <ul>

        <li>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced</li>

        <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>

        <li>½ cup diced celery</li>

        <li>½ cup diced yellow onion</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

        <li>7 ounces ground beef</li>

        <li>6 ounces ground pork</li>

        <li>½ cup dry red wine</li>

        <li>2 cups vegetable broth, divided, more as needed</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start preparing ragù by sautéeing pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat renders, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook, stirring until vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook while mashing meat into small pieces until browned, 5 to 7 minutes</li>
        <li>Add wine and bring to a boil. Add 1 cup broth and tomato sauce. Reduce heat to low, and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer ragù, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Add 1 more cup of broth to ragù. Continue simmering, stirring often, until very thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if necessary; ragù should drop, not run, off a spoon. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Start preparing pasta after ragù is cooked. Bring water and salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Add spinach, cover, and return to a boil. Cook, stirring gently, until spinach is heated through. Remove from heat, leave covered, and let cool.</li>
